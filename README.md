# FPGA_PROJECT

Project statement:
Read in the image from a laptop-camera, store it in block RAM, display it on VGA. Transform the image and display it in real-time on the VGA monitor.

Project hierarchy:
1.	Implementation of VGA controller with FPGA 
2.	Interfacing the UART for transferring the image to the FPGA
3.	Implementing a real time parallel interface for the image taken from laptop camera to be displayed on the screen using VGA controller
4.	Transforming the image, applying image blurring using image convolution, and displaying it on FPGA

The report(FPGA_report) can be seen under the file section in the repository.   
The code files and the python script coded for this project can also be seen in the same section as above.
